# GA-Trail
Basic Game Prototype | Oregon Trail Spin-off

**Contributors**: Karly Hoffman, Rena Banka

### About:
Since both of us recently moved from California to attend General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in Chicago, we decided to create a spin-off of the Oregon Trail game of our journey to the mid-west.

### Instructions:
Get from California to Chicago as fast as you can, and as cheap as possible! The longer it takes you, the more you spend. You'll be asked questions along the way if you'd like stay longer in certain places. The catch? If you're one of the lucky ones, seeing atttractions could get you there faster than those who choose not to see attractions!

### Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Approach:
- Establish wireframes and user story
- Create HTML structure
- Split work into two parts: CSS (Rena) and JavaScript (Karly)
- Communicate often on progress!
- Deploy on GitHub when completed
