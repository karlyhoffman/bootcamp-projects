## Layouts Challenge

> *Fork & Clone this repository*

You are provided with a PDF of "grey box" drawings. You must create HTML and CSS layouts for **each** of the layouts. Fork and clone this repository. You will need an HTML and CSS file for each layout (keep things organized - one folder for each layout).

The PDF included "gray box" drawings of page layouts that are increasingly difficult to achieve using CSS. These are intended to be used after being introducing to the basics of `float` and `clear`. These exercises are meant to help you explore the basics and practice to develop a better intuitive sense for how `float` and `clear` work.

Please also note that we are not providing finished HTML and CSS for these exercises. We've found that HTML and CSS style can vary considerably from person to person, so please feel free to take your own approach to these quick layout wireframes.

#### Expectations

We expect each student to complete _as many of these as possible_. If that means you complete 1, great. If you finish all of them, fantastic. You should continue working on these problems after submission to practice your CSS skills until you complete this challenge.

#### Submission

* `git add`
* `git commit -m "fin"`
* `git push`
* Open repository on Github & **Create Pull Request**. 
* Submit Pull Request (do not close!)
