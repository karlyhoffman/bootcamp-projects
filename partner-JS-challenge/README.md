# Partner JS Challenge - Practice Problems

Let's work on a few problems to get your developer chops up to par! Use your user input skills to solve the following problems:

##if/else
Create a conditional or control flow statement (either switch or if) that detects if a student is of the appropriate age to purchase alcohol. Alert them with either a success or failure message. Verify user input using prompt. Make sure to check the type of the value prompt returns and parseFloat if need be!

##user input
You're at a large convention and are running a sign-up booth for a product. Developers that visit your booth need to be able to signup for your newsletter. Create an empty array of developers and another array for their email addresses. Research the String.split() and String.join() methods for splitting strings apart. You'll need to split the first and last names. Using window.prompt(), ask for their name and email address. Use Array.push to add to these arrays. Add each name to your developers array using the lastname, firstname format. console.log() both the name and email of the user. This will require you to research string manipulation and changing. You may find some random names (check out https://randomuser.me/) or populate data from your classmates.
